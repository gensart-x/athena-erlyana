# Configurations  

> ðŸš§ Do note that this project is still on development, it **might** have impact changes, including this configurations method.  

!> Because the project are still on development, and I need to record the changes to version control, and the environment data will be recorded too. Though, you may provide some feedback / suggestion for this, I may be appreciate that ðŸ’–.

#### ! UPDATE !
I have installed `dotenv` library to store several sensitive variables like tokens in `.env` file. Currently, I do record the `env` variables to version control. Maybe soon, I'll find a way to create an interface for that, so you will know what variables are used for the app.

As of current version, I put some global configurations too on a Typescript file in : `./src/env.ts`.  
You can do several things like changing Bot name, short name, or codename (used for watermarking sticker author, etc.)
