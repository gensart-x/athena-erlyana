## Video/GIF/similar format processing
I've tried some features like Image to Sticker, when I send some media like video format (MP4/AAC), it can't process the request correctly.

I've been searched why and how, and the wwebjs.dev library clearly says on this [page](https://wwebjs.dev/guide/creating-your-bot/handling-attachments.html#caveat-for-sending-videos-and-gifs)
